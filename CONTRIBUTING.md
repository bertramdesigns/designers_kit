## Git Workflow

After some trial and research, I have chosen to use the Github Flow for this project. However, I will name the main branch `develop` and follow [PenpotÂ´s](https://github.com/penpot/penpot?tab=readme-ov-file) example.

My reasoning is that it is a proven and long-standing workflow that is much easier to contribute to. This will likely never be a large team, but it can be scaled to a psuedo-gitlabs style workflow if needed. I will prepare the releases offline based on the tagging to make sure all tests pass and the release is ready to go.
